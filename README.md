## Setting up DDNS

    In my case I'm using cloudflare as is my domain provider.

1. Sign in to your Cloudflare account at https://www.cloudflare.com.

2. Select the domain you want to set up DDNS for from the dashboard.

3. Go to the "DNS" section in the Cloudflare dashboard and ensure that the DNS record for your domain is of type "A" and is proxied.
